      Indian Health Center has continued to provide world-class care to the
      Native American/Alaskan Native community for 30 years now because of
      the support from people like yourself. Your donations allow our organization
      to help thousands of people a year and we thank you for that.
    </p>
    <p>If you've never donated before, take a moment to look below at the many ways you can help.
        Donate what you can afford as every bit helps.

      <p> Because the Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley is a nonprofit organization,
        we rely on support from individuals, foundations and corporations to enable us to offer
        opportunities to provide health services for American Indians, Alaskan Natives and
        other uninsured or underinsured members of our community.
