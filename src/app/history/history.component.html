      <ul class="timeline">
        <li>
          <h6>Prior to 1950</h6>
          <p>Most American Indians lived on reservations, in nearly rural towns, or in tribal jurisdictional
            areas
            such as Oklahoma.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>In the 1950s</h6>
          <p> The federal government passed legislation to terminate its legal obligations to Indian tribes. They
            terminated their obligations to 109 tribes and created programs to assimilate American Indians into
            mainstream
            American society, the largest of which was the Relocation Program. From 1953-1970, the Bureau of Indian
            Affairs ran
            a
            Relocation Program where they offered a one-way bus ticket and some training for Indians to move from their
            traditional homes on the reservation to urban areas. American Indians from many different tribes moved, and
            many
            came
            to cities in California.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>In the 1960s</h6>
          <p>American Indians started to gather for support, and began advocating for culturally appropriate
            health
            programs addressing the unique social, cultural and health needs of AI/ANs living in urban settings. By
            1969, over
            160,000 American Indians had been relocated to live in urban areas.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>In 1965s</h6>
          <p>American Indian community members in Santa Clara County formed the United American Indians of Santa Clara
            Valley, Inc., and in 1969 created the Indian Community Center of San Jose.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>In the 1970s</h6>
          <p>The United American Indians of Santa Clara Valley, Inc. reorganized its clubhouse into a community-based
            information and referral agency under a board of directors representing many Indian nations. The new
            organization
            became the San Jose American Indian Center.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>In 1975</h6>
          <p>The Indian Center established a one-desk health unit. By 1977, the unit grew large enough to become an
            agency of its own. The newly incorporated Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley, Inc. started as a
            poorly
            funded
            not-for-profit clinic with no private examination rooms, dental chairs held together with dental floss, and
            no
            running water.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>In the 1990s</h6>
          <p>The organization has been recognized by the Indian Health Service as an Urban Indian Health Program
            in
            California. In 1993, the IHC obtained Federally Qualified Health Care Status (FQHC). In 2001, the IHC was
            surveyed
            by
            the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC).</p>

    <h4 class="text-center mb-5 text-success">Today Over Two-Thirds (2/3) Of American Indians Live In Urban Areas.</h4>
    <p>California is home to one of the largest American Indian populations in the country, which includes
      federally-recognized tribes, non-federally recognized tribes, tribes that were terminated by the US government,
      state recognized tribes, tribes petitioning for state and federal recognition, and urban Indian communities. In
      fact, some of the largest concentrations of American Indians in the U.S. live in California cities.</p>
    <p>
      The land upon which the IHC's buildings sit is the homeland of the local indigenous tribe, the Muwekma Ohlone
      Tribe
      of the San Francisco Bay Area. The Muwekma is comprised of all the known surviving American Indian lineages
      aboriginal to the San Francisco Bay Region and whose members and descendants are from the historic Federally
      Recognized Verona Band. The Muwekma are Federally recognized but have been fighting to have their status
      clarified
      and reaffirmed for over 20 years. IHC thanks and honors the Muwekma Ohlone tribe of the San Francisco Bay Area
      for
      their generosity and hospitality with their Tribe's ancestral and historic homeland.</p>

    <h4 class="text-center mb-5 text-success">The Occupation Of Alcatraz Island</h4>
    <p>For 19 months from 1969-1971, American Indians occupied Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay to protest and
      bring awareness to the deplorable conditions that American Indians were living in, both on the reservation and
      off.</p>
    <p>
      Nixon's speech spurred a number of legislative acts during the 1970s including self-determination and control
      over programs and services to American Indians; protection of American Indian children; and religious freedom to
      worship through traditional ceremonies and rites.</p>

              </h5>
              <p>
                The first location of the Indian Community Center was a modest building on North San Pedro about four
                blocks south of Taylor. While it is now in the afternoon shadow of Highway 87, during that time it
                stood alone outside of downtown San Jose with not much around it. This was the only place in all of
                Santa Clara County that American Indians could call their own; the next closest facilities were in San
                Francisco and Oakland.
              </p>
              <p>
                Around 1975 the Community Center established a one-desk health information and referral unit. The
                Community Center hired its first community health workers and initial services offered were pre-natal
                nutrition education and parenting services. This was the start of what was later to become the Indian
                Health Center of Santa Clara Valley.

              </h5>
              <p>
                This shop housed the Indian Community Center from 1975 to 1976. It is located just north of San
                Fernando Street in downtown San Jose. Although this is prime real estate today, back in the 1970s it
                was on the edge of town. This place served as a gathering place for the American Indian community.
                Indian sports programs for fast pitch softball and basketball were coordinated by the Center. During
                this time the Indian Community Center began developing a library to support the American Indian
                education programs that were being created.

                Location #3: San Jose East Foothill (1976-1985)
                3485 East Hills Drive (By Alum Rock & White)
              </h5>
              <p> In an effort to move away from the hustle and bustle of downtown San Jose, the Indian Community
                Center moved to this location in the east hills of San Jose.</p>

              <p>In 1976 the US Congress passed the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA), whose goal was to
                elevate the health of American Indians/Alaska Natives to the level of other populations. Title V of the
                IHCIA established urban Indian health programs in cities where Indians had been relocated, and was
                created to meet the health needs of Indian living in urban areas, away from their traditional
                communities.</p>

              <p>In March 1977, with funds from Title V, the Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley amicably
                separated from the Indian Community Center and was incorporated as a separate non-profit to address the
                health care needs of the American Indian community in Santa Clara Valley.</p>

              <p>The Medical Department was created with one doctor, a nurse practitioner, and a medical assistant. In
                1978 Dr. Anne Verstraete, who was with the IHC for 32 years until her retirement in 2010, was the
                second doctor hired. The conditions of the center were rustic: the Medical Department used kindergarten
                trailers and had only curtains to separate exam rooms, and there was no running water.</p>

              <p>The Dental Department also got their start at the East Hills location, starting with one dentist and
                one dental assistant.</p>

              <p>The nutrition education services that had started IHC turned into a program when IHC was able to
                secure a grant from the state of California to provide WIC (Women-Infant-Children) services. The
                WIC/Nutrition Department was created and IHC is only 1 of 2 non-profit organizations, other than the
                county, that provides WIC services to Santa Clara County residents.</p>

              <p>After six years at this location the Health Center and the Community Center decided to relocate. IHC
                needed more space and moved into its own facility on East Santa Clara Street, while the Indian
                Community Center moved back downtown to a location on The Alameda by Stockton Avenue.</p>

              </h5>
              <p>
                For almost 10 years IHC was located at this site on East Santa Clara Street. With a larger and visible
                facility, IHC was able to serve more community members.</p>

              <p> During this period, IHC started its Counseling Department with a focus on alcohol and substance abuse
                counseling. Over time, this expanded to include mental health counseling , crisis intervention, case
                management and psychiatric services.</p>

              <p> In 1993, IHC became a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). IHC's Board decided to open the
                Center's service to non-American Indians because they saw there was a tremendous need for culturally
                proficient health care service designed to serve low-income people in the community.</p>

              <p>
                In 1994, IHC needed a much larger facility to house its expanded services. The move to this central San
                Jose location provided significantly more operating area for all of IHC's programs. IHC's Medical,
                Dental, Counseling, and WIC departments were all located in this building, along with finance and
                administrative staff.

                The 2000 Census reported that in the Santa Clara Valley area there were 26,648 American Indians
                representing over 180 tribes, most with incomes below the federal poverty level. Lacking resources,
                culturally appropriate care, and family support, many urban Indians experience disease and mortality
                rates several times greater than the general public. Diabetes is one disease that is particularly
                devastating. A report by the Urban Indian Health Institute estimates that despite significant miscoding
                of diabetic Indians as non-Indians by health care professionals and government research, Indians in
                urban areas have mortality rates due to diabetes that are 53% higher than those of the general
                population. The hospitalization rate of Indians for diabetes in San Jose is 48% higher than the general
                population.
