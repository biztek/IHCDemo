  <div class="title">The Indian Health Center Of Santa Clara Valley's History</div>
  <div class="content text-justify">
    <p>Prior to 1950, most American Indians lived on reservations, in nearly rural towns, or in tribal jurisdictional areas such as Oklahoma.
    <p>In the 1950s the federal government passed legislation to terminate its legal obligations to Indian tribes. They terminated their obligations to 109 tribes and created programs to assimilate American Indians into mainstream American society, the largest of which was the Relocation Program. From 1953-1970, the Bureau of Indian Affairs ran a Relocation Program where they offered a one-way bus ticket and some training for Indians to move from their traditional homes on the reservation to urban areas. American Indians from many different tribes moved, and many came to cities in California.</p>
    <p>In the 1960s American Indians started to gather for support, and began advocating for culturally appropriate health programs addressing the unique social, cultural and health needs of AI/ANs living in urban settings. By 1969, over 160,000 American Indians had been relocated to live in urban areas.</p>
    <p>In 1965 American Indian community members in Santa Clara County formed the United American Indians of Santa Clara Valley, Inc., and in 1969 created the Indian Community Center of San Jose.</p>
    <p>In 1970, the United American Indians of Santa Clara Valley, Inc. reorganized its clubhouse into a community-based information and referral agency under a board of directors representing many Indian nations. The new organization became the San Jose American Indian Center.</p>
    <p>In 1975, the Indian Center established a one-desk health unit. By 1977, the unit grew large enough to become an agency of its own. The newly incorporated Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley, Inc. started as a poorly funded not-for-profit clinic with no private examination rooms, dental chairs held together with dental floss, and no running water.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, the organization has been recognized by the Indian Health Service as an Urban Indian Health Program in California. In 1993, the IHC obtained Federally Qualified Health Care Status (FQHC). In 2001, the IHC was surveyed by the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC).</p>
