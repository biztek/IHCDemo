      <p><strong>Fitness Program</strong><br>
        CWO operates a Fitness Center that is open to all IHC patients. The Fitness Center is equipped with elliptical
        machines, treadmills, recumbent bikes, dumbbells and an assortment of strength and cardio machines. The gym
        offers
        group exercise classes including Walking Spirit (a walking group), Arthritis Foundation Exercise Program (chair
        exercise), Pilates, Yoga, Zumba, and Zumba in a Circuit (a circuit class that alternated between dancing and
        utilizing fitness equipment). Fitness staff develop individualized fitness plans for you and your family with
        recommendations from Indian Health Center medical providers.</p>

      <p>A physical clearance form needs to be completed by your medical provider before joining the fitness program.
        The
        Medical Clearance forms are essentially a doctor's note from a patient's primary care physician, that states
        the
        patient is able to work out and lists any limitation the patient may have. The forms are to be updated once a
        year.
        <strong>Please note,</strong> it is the patient's responsibility to notify the Fitness Program of any changes
        in
        health and obtain an updated medical clearance. </p>
